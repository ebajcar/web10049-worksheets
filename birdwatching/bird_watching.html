For this project, your task is to take the content for the homepage of a bird watching website and add structural elements to it so it can have a page layout applied to it. It needs to have:
  A header spanning the full width of the site containing the main title for the page, the site logo, and the navigation menu. The title and logo appear side by side once styling is applied, and the navigation appears below those two items.
  A main content area containing two columns â€” a main block to contain the welcome text, and a sidebar to contain image thumbnails.
  A footer containing copyright information and credits.

You need to add a suitable wrapper for:
  The header
  The navigation menu
  The main content
  The welcome text
  The image sidebar
  The footer

    <p>Welcome to our fake birdwatching site. If this were a real site, it would be the ideal place 
       to come to learn more about birdwatching, whether you are a beginner looking to learn how to 
       get into birding, or an expert wanting to share ideas, tips, and photos with other 
       like-minded people.</p>
    <p>So don't waste time! Get what you need, then turn off that computer and get out 
       into the great outdoors! </p>
