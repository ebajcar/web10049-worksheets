- [ ] Create a file called `index.html` and store it in the root folder of your project.
- [ ] Create the sub-directories `images` and `css` in the root folder.
- [ ] Test your project locally.
- [ ] Validate your html at `validator.w3.org` using *Validate by Direct Input* tab.
- [ ] Publish to dev.fast.sheridanc.on.ca in `public_html/syst10049/letter`.
- [ ] Test using Chrome browser at http://username.dev.fast.sheridanc.on.ca/*pathname* (don't forget to substitute username for your user name and pathname appropriately).
- [ ] Validate using *Validate by URI*.

2. Mark up the content of a memo (continued from Worksheet 1).
- [ ] Create a project directory (folder) called `memo` in `C:\public_html\syst10049\`.

- [ ] Test using Chrome browser at http://*username*.dev.fast.sheridanc.on.ca/*pathname* (don't forget to substitute username for your user name and pathname appropriately).
- [ ] Validate using *Validate by URI*.

3. Repeat for every example from last week
    - example01_001.html a basic HTML5 document that renders the phrase “Hello World!”
    - example01_002.html minimal HTML5 document with sample comments, including prologue (header)
    - [fig311_1.html](../../set_a/fig311_1.html) HTML5 document; headings and paragraphs
    - [fig312_2.html](../../set_a/fig312_2.html) HTML5 document; emphasizing words and phrases
    - [fig312_3.html](../../set_a/fig312_3.html) HTML5 document; show how changing the stress emphasis changes the meaning
    - [fig312_4.html](../../set_a/fig312_4.html) HTML5 document; showing importance
    - [fig313_5.html](../../set_a/fig313_5.html) HTML5 document; scientific names and foreign words

4. Using nested list or indentation (you can also draw boxes,if you prefer), draw or create outline of your webspace, after completing these exercises (omit other stuff you may have there; I would suggest to move everything to another subdirectory).
