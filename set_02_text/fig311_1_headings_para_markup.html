    <h3>How Dorothy saved the Scarecrow.</h3>
    
    <p>Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry. So she went 
    to the cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with 
    butter. She gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she 
    carried it down to the little brook and filled it with clear, 
    sparkling water. Toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the 
    birds sitting there. Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious 
    fruit hanging from the branches that she gathered some of it, finding 
    it just what she wanted to help out her breakfast.</p>
    
    <p>Then she went back to the house, and having helped[Pg 32] 
    herself and Toto to a good drink of the cool, clear water, she set 
    about making ready for the journey to the City of Emeralds.</p>
