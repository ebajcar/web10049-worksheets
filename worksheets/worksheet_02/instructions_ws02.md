3. Repeat for every example from last week
    - example01_001.html a basic HTML5 document that renders the phrase “Hello World!”
    - example01_002.html minimal HTML5 document with sample comments, including prologue (header)
    - fig311_1.html HTML5 document; headings and paragraphs
    - fig312_2.html HTML5 document; emphasizing words and phrases
    - fig312_3.html HTML5 document; show how changing the stress emphasis changes the meaning
    - fig312_4.html HTML5 document; showing importance
    - fig313_5.html HTML5 document; scientific names and foreign words

4. Using nested list or indentation (you can also draw boxes,if you prefer), draw or create outline of your webspace, after completing these exercises (omit other stuff you may have there; I would suggest to move everything to another subdirectory).
