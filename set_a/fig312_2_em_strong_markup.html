<!-- emphasizing words and phrases -->
<p>If you need to emphasize a word or a particular fact in 
a sentence, you can use italics to stress it. That said, italics 
and other font changes lose their impact if overused. Use it 
sparingly and rely on strong writing and <em>strategic word 
placement</em> to get your point across.</p>

<p>Boldface fonts can be used sparsely to draw attention 
to words or short phrases, and are most often seen in business 
writing. <strong>Using boldface for emphasis is not 
appropriate for academic writing.</strong>
