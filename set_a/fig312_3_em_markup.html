<!-- These examples show how changing the stress emphasis changes 
the meaning. First, a general statement of fact, with no stress: -->
<p>Cats are cute animals.</p>

<!-- By emphasizing the first word, the statement implies that 
the kind of animal under discussion is in question (maybe someone 
is asserting that dogs are cute): -->
<p><em>Cats</em> are cute animals.</p>

<!-- Moving the stress to the verb, one highlights that the truth 
of the entire sentence is in question (maybe someone is saying cats 
are not cute): -->
<p>Cats <em>are</em> cute animals.</p>

<!-- By moving it to the adjective, the exact nature of the cats 
is reasserted (maybe someone suggested cats were mean animals): -->
<p>Cats are <em>cute</em> animals.</p>

<!-- Similarly, if someone asserted that cats were vegetables, 
someone correcting this might emphasize the last word: -->
<p>Cats are cute <em>animals</em>.</p>

<!-- By emphasizing the entire sentence, it becomes clear that 
the speaker is fighting hard to get the point across. This kind of 
stress emphasis also typically affects the punctuation, hence the 
exclamation mark here. -->
<p><em>Cats are cute animals!</em></p>

<!-- Anger mixed with emphasizing the cuteness could lead to 
markup such as: -->
<p><em>Cats are <em>cute</em> animals!</em></p>
